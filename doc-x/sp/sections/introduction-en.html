<p>In order to be able to express in a formal way the main claim(s) of a scientific article expressed as an AIDA sentence, we have developed a new ontology that encompasses a super-pattern.

The main parts of this super-pattern are the context, subject and object classes. The subject and object need to be in the context of the context class, while the subject and the object are linked through a relation. This relation also includes a qualifier to make the relation between the subject and object more specific. An example of the instantiation of the super-pattern is shown in the diagram below.
