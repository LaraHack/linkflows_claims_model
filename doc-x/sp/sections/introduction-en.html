<p>In order to be able to express in a formal way the main claim(s) of a scientific article expressed as an AIDA sentence, we have developed a new ontology that encompasses a super-pattern. As the main claims cannot be expressed as simple statements that can be formalized using RDF technologies, developing a super-pattern was necessary. The main parts of this super-pattern are the context, subject and object classes. The subject and object need to be in the context of the context class, while the subject and the object are linked through a relation. This relation also includes a qualifier to make the relation between the subject and object more specific. An example of the instantiation of the super-pattern is shown in the diagram below. As such, in the context of all “persons”, things of type “obesity and metabolic abnormality” “generally” have a relation of type “co-occurs with” to things of type “knee osteoarthritis”:</p>
