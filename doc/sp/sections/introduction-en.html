<p>An ontology to express in a formal way high-level scientific claims. It encompasses a super-pattern, a formal structure in which the semantic claims can be represented. An instance of this super-pattern consists of a context class, a subject class, a qualifier, a relation and an object class.

<h3 id="intro" class="list">Relations</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;___<b>is same as</b>: "[subj] and [obj] are the same individual" <br>
|___<b>compares to</b>: "[quantifiable-subj] compares to the [quantifiable-obj]" <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>has similar value as</b>: "[quantifiable-subj] has a value that is similar with [quantifiable-obj]" <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>has same value as</b>: "[quantifiable-subj] has the same value as [quantifiable-obj]" <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>has different value from</b>: "[quantifiable-subj] has a value that is different from [quantifiable-obj]" <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>has smaller value than</b>: "[quantifiable-subj] has a smaller value than [quantifiable-obj]" <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>has larger value than</b>: "[quantifiable-subj] has a larger value than [quantifiable-obj] <br>
|___<b>has causal relationship with</b>: "[subj] has causal relation with [obj]" <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>affects</b>: "[subj] affects the activity of [obj] in the sense of positively or negatively affecting its intensity or frequency" <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>contributes to</b>: "[subj] contributes to the activity of [obj] in sense of positively affecting its intensity or frequency" <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>enables</b>: "[subj] causes the activity of [obj] to happen" <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>inhibits</b>: "[subj] inhibits the activity of [obj] in sense of negatively affecting its intensity or frequency" <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>prevents</b>: "[subj] causes the activity of [obj] not to happen" <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>increases</b>: "[subj] causes the value of [obj] to increase" <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>decreases</b>: "[subj] causes the value of [obj] to decrease" <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>requires</b>: "[subj] would not exist if [obj] did not exist" <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>causes</b>: "[subj] causes the existence of [obj]" <br>
|&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>is caused by</b>: "the existence of [subj] is caused by [obj]" <br>
|___<b>has spatio-temporal relationship with</b>: "[subj] has a spatial and/or temporal relation with [obj]" <br>
&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>includes</b>: "[subj] spatiotemporally includes [obj]" <br>
&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>is included in</b>: "[obj] spatiotemporally includes [subj]" <br>
&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>co-occurs with</b>: "[subj] is close to [obj] in terms of space and time" <br>
&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>is followed by</b>: "[subj] comes into existence before [obj]" <br>
&emsp;&emsp;|___<b>follows</b>: "[obj] comes into existence before [subj]" <br>

<h3 id="intro" class="list">Qualifiers</h3>
<p>
  There are five basic qualifiers that can be used: <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;___<b>always</b>: "true in 100% of cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>generally</b>: "true in at least 90% of the cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>mostly</b>: "true in at least 50% of cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>frequently</b>: "true in at least 10% of cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>sometimes</b>: "true in at least 0.1% of cases" <br>
</p>
<p>
  These basic qualifiers also come with their negative counterparts: <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;___<b>never</b>: "true in 0% of cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>generally not</b>: "true in at most 10% of cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>mostly not</b>: "true in at most 50% of cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>frequently not</b>: "true in at most 90% of cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>sometimes not</b>: "true in at most 99.9% of cases" <br>
</p>
<p>
  On top of that, these qualifiers can also be modified with "can" and are interpreted according to modal logic semantics of possible worlds. “Can” therefore means “there is at least one accessible possible world where the given statement is true” or “it is possible to make it become true”. These qualifiers are oftern used in fields like medicine and computer science. <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;___<b>can always</b>: "can be made true in all 100% cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>can generally</b>: "can be made true in at least 90% of cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>can mostly</b>: "can be made true in at least 50% of cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>can frequently</b>: "can be made true in at least 10% of cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>can sometimes</b>: "can be made true in at least 0.1% of cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>can never</b>: "can be made true in 0% of cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>can generally not</b>: "can be made true in at most 10% of cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>can mostly not</b>: "can be made true in at most 50% of cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>can frequently not</b>: "can be made true in at most 90% of cases" <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;|___<b>can sometimes not</b>: "can be made true in at most 99.9% of cases" <br>
